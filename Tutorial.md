# The first thing that you want to do when adding bold to text in markdown is make sure you have your sentence is properly working.
## An example of this would be to add either one, two , or three hashtags, "#". This will ensure that your sentence is ready to be processed through the website. Once you have done this than you can add either one or two astericks to the front and the back of the sentence, "*". One asterick will add italized text, and two astericks will add bolded text.
